Creating IAM roles and attaching policies to the roles
Because AWS follows the principle of least privilege, we recommend that you provide role-based access to only the AWS resources that are required to perform a task. In this step, you create IAM roles and attach policies to the roles.

In the navigation pane of the IAM dashboard, choose Roles.

Choose Create role and in the Select trusted entity page, configure the following settings:
Trusted entity type: AWS service
Common use cases: Lambda
Choose Next.

On the Add permissions page, select Lambda-Write-DynamoDB and Lambda-Read-SQS.

Choose Next

For Role name, enter Lambda-SQS-DynamoDB.

Choose Create role.

Follow the previous steps to create two more IAM roles:

An IAM role for AWS Lambda: This role grants permissions to obtain records from the DynamoDB streams and send the records to Amazon SNS. Use the following information to create the role.
IAM role name: Lambda-DynamoDBStreams-SNS
Trusted entity type: AWS service
Common use cases: Lambda
Attach policies: Lambda-SNS-Publish and Lambda-DynamoDBStreams-Read
An IAM role for Amazon API Gateway: This role grants permissions to send data to the SQS queue and push logs to Amazon CloudWatch for troubleshooting. Use the following information to create the role.
IAM role name: APIGateway-SQS
Trusted entity type: AWS service
Common use cases: API Gateway
Attach policies: AmazonAPIGatewayPushToCloudWatchLogs
